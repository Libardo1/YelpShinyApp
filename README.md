Yelp Hotspot Mapper Shiny App
============

This is documentation for the Yelp Hotspot Mapper app.

The web app takes in any text input search term and selected city location and creates a hotspot visualization map.
The app web scrapes Yelp review data and maps it using the ggmap package to geocode and create the hotspot visualization.
The app currently only includes 4 city map locations: Orange County, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and San Diego. This selection
will be improved in a future update.
